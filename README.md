# Premier_League_Stats_ML_Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Premier League player performance across an entire season to identify top-performing players and efficient teams. By calculating a custom Player Impact Score-combining goals, assists, shots on goal, and games played- I assessed individual contributions. Team efficiency metrics such as Goals per Game, Shots per Goal, and Impact per Game were calculated to evaluate team performance. Using visualizations like bar plots and scatter plots, I highlighted top players, top teams, and player finishing efficiency. Additionally, I applied machine learning techniques, including KMeans clustering to group players by scoring efficiency and Linear Regression to quantify the relationship between shot accuracy and goals per game. The analysis revealed the most impactful players, efficient teams, and insights into player scoring behavior.
